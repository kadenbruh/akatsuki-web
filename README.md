# Intro

This project is https://next.akatsuki.gg -- the next major iteration of Akatsuki's frontend.

We have recently modernized our infrastructure and are now looking forward to modernizing our frontend app & tooling, to reduce maintenance costs, increase developer productivity and to ease building of new features.

# Contributing

Any testing (either running your own locally, or simply using the site @ https://next.akatsuki.gg) and any candid feedback on the usability, design or performance of the site is much appreciated!

We're also looking to increase the size of our development teams. Interested? Send a message to cmyui!
